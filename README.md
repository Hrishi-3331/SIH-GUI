# SIH-GUI

Pending work - 

1. Connecting Details column (Heart rate/temperature/BP/Location/activity) with firebase database and updating the contents of these columns automatically without refreshing the page (hint : you can use AJAX)

2. Current page is not supposed to be the homepge of GUI. Homepage of GUI is supposed to display location of all the soldiers and few other details that you people have to think. When we click on any particular soldier then the current page should open and details of that soldiers should be shown.

3. Make webpage more interactive and stick to the theme and colors currently used.

Try to complete the task asap.
